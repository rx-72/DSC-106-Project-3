# Setting up D3 context graph steps below:

## 1. Follow steps for lab 4 to set up svelte app in designated directory. Make sure to also install d3 from lab 5

## 2. you'll need to create components as you did in lab 4 and an App.svelte (plus graph.svelte).

## 3. Copy the app.svelte, graph.svelte, and +page.svelte templates on this repository to your create files. (app and graph should be in components, +page should be in under routes)

## 4. Add the csv file to your static folder. This is where "fetch()" will grab the csv data from.

## 5. open the website on your terminal via "npm run dev -- --open".
